##What the heck?##
This repo is supposed to hold some small scripts which can be used to troll around the internet (if nothing else).
These are actually example code snippets I am making while learning new things. I am posting them here with a hope that these will prove helpful for someone or atleast I myself can use them as examples for teaching some new programmer (I love teaching stuff, and people grasp pretty fast when doing wrong things).  

Here is the list of all the scripts included in this repo with descriptions:

##fullonsms.py##
*You need to sign up at fullonsms.com* to use this.  
This script forge http requests to send sms through fullonsms.com. Since it usess fullonsms.com which is available only in India, this might be of no use for others.

###Usage###
Just run <code>python fullonsms.py</code> and follow the instructions. *You need to sign up at fullonsms.com*

###Status###
Was working till the push date.
